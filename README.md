# No-link

### Running with `web-ext`
From the extension's directory:

`

While link's formatting is hidden, link's text will show as "regular text".

Even while "unformatted" links are still active and can be accessed.

## Why no-link?

Intended utilisation is to improve concentration while reading content online (blog posts, articles, etc).

While useful, links divert our attention. If you prefer concentrating on any single content without having to worry about links to other pages, just hide links formatting with No-link!
